            <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>

            <p>
              Emotional Intelligence can be described as one's ability to recognize, understand, manage, and handle emotions.
            </p>

            <h3>How is EQ different from IQ?</h3>

            <p>
              IQ is very useful, it measures your ability to retain knowledge, to analyze information, you logical reasoning, and your cognitive functions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Whereas EQ measures your ability to recognize, understand, manage, and handle your emotions and others.
            </p>

            <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>

            <p>
              According to the psychology lecturer at The University of Sydney, 
              <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2012/09/11/3587590.htm?trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block">Dr Carolyn MacCann</a>, the differences in people's IQ 
              scores accounts for roughly 25% of their job performance, however the difference in people’s EQ can explain for a little over 3% of people’s job performance. This isn’t to say 
              EQ is less important than IQ, for a high EQ is paramount in helping people deal with their well-being, stress management and interactions with others in the workplace, making 
              anyone with a high emotional intelligence a valuable asset for any company.
            </p>

            <p>
              To add onto that, Dr Carolyn’s research also found that the differences in people’s emotional intelligence can account for around 29% of the differences in people’s eudaimonic 
              well being, which is the pursuit of meaning, virtue, and growth. Whereas the flipped side of that coin is hedonism, which is the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, 
              avoiding pain and sheltering yourself away from challenge leads to stagnation is one's own ability to learn and change for the better.
            </p>

            <p>
              Having a high EQ inherently means you have a greater capacity than people with a low EQ to perceive not only other people's emotions, but your own and how to regulate them. 
              With a heightened awareness of your own self and how and why you are feeling certain emotions can help you build stable relationships, reduce stress for yourself and others, 
              de-escalate conflicts, improve work satisfaction, and 
              <a href="https://www.latrobe.edu.au/nest/why-emotional-intelligence-makes-you-more-successful/#:~:text=Emotional%20intelligence%20is%20the%20ability,conflict%20and%20improve%20job%20satisfaction.">
              make you more successful</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion EQ is important for better cohesion in not only a workplace but your own life, having a high EQ can help with your personal relationships with family, friends, 
             and lovers. It can also help you better regulate your own emotions and increase your overall well-being.
