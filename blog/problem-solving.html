            <h3>A problem I struggled with</h3>

            <p>
              When working through the Javascript Kata, the first challenge was to do with Variables and Arrays.
              I needed to reassign 4 variables without changing the original variables of each. I found this incredibly easy and quick to do.
              The technique I used was "trying something", literally just went over it and did what felt right and it all worked right away.
            </p>

            <h3>A problem I excelled with</h3>

            <p>
              When I was working on the second task of the Javascript Kata, the second challenge was to do with Manipulating Objects and I found it quite difficult for some time.
              The problem I was having was I needed to assign an new object to an object in an object, a mouthful I know. Objects have keys inside of them which then in turn have
              a value assigned to them. I needed to create an object that was the first objects key, and then add another object inside of that object from outside with it's own 
              key and value. The problem solving method I used was Googling, I stumbled my way to the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools website</a> to look at all 
              the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_methods.asp">Object Methods</a>, and I found one called "Object.assign", it allowed me from the outside of an 
              object to assign an object to another object and beomce its key.
            </p>

            <h3>Confidence on problem-solving techniques</h3>

            <p>
              The following is a list of problem solving techniques/processes that I have been asked to reflect on my confidence with them.<br>
              1. "Pseudocode" is not something I have much experience with but I am excited to use more often.<br>
              2. "Trying something" is something a excel at doing, I tend to look back at what I've learnt and smash certain parts of code together that seem like it would work.<br>
              3. The "Rubber ducky method" is a personal favourite of mine, although it does make me sound a bit crazy talking to nobody, it does tend to lead me in the right 
              direction and finding out where I messed up.<br>
              4. "Reading error messages", I haven't really looked at many error messages, when I do it's just to find it in the code and to figure out what's wrong with it in the 
              code editor, so that definitely needs work.
              5. "Console.logging" is something I'm not very used to doing, I see the appeal and I do plan to do it more often, however I haven't had much of a chance recently to use it
              because I've been only doing tasks on my code editor and terminal for the most part.
              6. "Googling", definitely the technique I use the most, whenever I'm stuck on anything I do a cheeky google search to often gain more insight into what I'm missing, I'm 
              quite confident in my ability to search for what I need.
              7. "Asking your peers for help", I don't do this at all, it's mainly because I've been able to figure most things out on my own without needing to go to my peers, 
              but my anxiety is definitely stopping me from doing so when I probably should, so it is something I need to work on.
              8. "Asking coaches for help", same with asking my peers for help, haven't had the need and my anxiety would likely stop me even if I needed to, I will endeavour to work 
              on that.
              9. "Improving your process with reflection", I 100% need to reflect more often, it's not something I particularly enjoy doing all the time, when I'm interested in 
              something I tend to reflect more, but with anything else that felt too easy or too hard I like to move on quick, so I definitely need to reflect more often.
            </p>

            <h3>Reflection on a time I was reluctant to ask for help</h3>

            <p>
              When doing my introduction to Javascript, the seventh challenge was on loops, it was learning the basics. I unfortunately got stuck on making a for loop 
              and wasn't willing to give up. I didn't end up asking for help even though it had taken more well over 30 minutes on one problem which was definitely grounds
              for seeking help from others. The reason why I didn't ask for help was because I was embarrased that it had taken me so long and that even after all the time I 
              had sunk into it I was still just as close to finishing the problem as I was at the beginning. Next time I will be more proactive at seeking help from my coaches 
              and peers when I'm stuck, hopefully through repitition I'll be more confident to ask earlier on and not waste so much time.
