            What is your long term goal or career pathway?
          </h3>

          <p>
            The end goal for me is to become a software developer. I've always wanted to get into coding since I was in primary school and it originally started with me wanting to create games. 
            However I just have a bit more confidence in software development as a long term career choice.
          </p>  

          <h3>
            A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:
          </h3>
          
          <p>
            My strength is that I’m a quick learner, I’ve had a good track record with picking things up fairly quickly, however the caveat or limitation I should say is that if I’m not interested 
            in the subject it then becomes quite a struggle for me to retain anything. But thankfully most things seem to interest me to varying degrees.
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </h3>
          
          <p>
            I would like to gain more confidence in being able to meet people and communicate important matters across in a timely manner, that is always something I’ve felt I lacked purely from anxiety 
            and I’m hoping through repetition I’ll eventually get used to it.
          </p>  

          <h2>My day plan for optimal productivity:</h2>
            <ol id="list">
              <li>I will be waking up around 7:45am</li>
              <li>Taking a 15 minute walk to get the necessary sunlight in my eyes to wake up</li>
              <li>Eat breakfast and make a coffee so I’m fed and alert</li>
              <li>Start working by 8:30am</li>
              <li>Work till 12:00pm in which I will have my break</li>
              <li>My break will consist of workouts for 40 minutes, then 20 minutes for eating lunch</li>
              <li>From 1pm onwards I will work until 5:30pm</li>
              <li>Then I will have dinner and likely stop for the day</li>
            </ol>

              What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you:
            </h3>

            <p>
              My process of getting unstuck or getting rid of stress involves a 5 minute walk around the house to clear the mind, or maybe even talk to mates. Works every time.
            </p>

            <h3>
              A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:
            </h3>

            <p>
              I am living with two family members currently in which I can very easily confide in if I’m needing help, and if it’s something more to do with my code then google and the discord will be what I use to help me figure out what’s wrong.
            </p>

            <h3>
              A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team:
            </h3>

            <p>
              What I’ve already been receiving, which is prompt communication when needed and very kind and open conversations.
            </p>

            <h3>
              Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
            </h3>

            <p>
              I have family gathering in which I need to be apart of, these are those commitments:
              Every Wednesday from 6pm till 9pm
              Every second Sunday from 3pm to 6pm
