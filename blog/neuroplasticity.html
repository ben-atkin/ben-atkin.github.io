            <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>

            <h3>How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h3>
            
            <p>
              It helps people become aware of the fact that their intelligence isn’t predisposed upon birth, it’s very much something that can be improved upon. 
              So in all, accepting the fact that you can learn new things through effort and repetition and that failing at something isn’t forever, it’s just not yet.
            </p>

            <h3>How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</h3>

            <p>
              To keep reminding myself that my brain is not at a fixed level of intelligence and I am capable just like all people to learn more and improve myself further, 
              to look up to others as examples to follow rather than as what I could never be.
            </p>

            <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>

            <p>
              <ol id="list">
                <li>Use your non-dominant hand more often.</li>
                <li>When performing new activities, do them frequently and actively think about every motion involved.</li>
                <li>Keep performing old activities to keep your synapses strong.</li>
              </ol>

            <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>

            <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>

            <p>
              A growth mindset can be described as having the understanding that your own intelligence is malleable and not predetermined at birth. This is relevant because we 
              are students, and most of us are trying to learn a new subject from scratch in a very small amount of time. The best chance of success for all of us is to have a 
              greater understanding of our own brains and how belief in one’s own capabilities and ability to change can impact our futures.
            </p>

            <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>

            <p>
              Not really, I always knew deep down that intelligence was not bestowed upon you at birth but rather something you work on, but I definitely say to myself that I’m 
              just not smart enough and leave it at that whenever I failed at something and got embarrassed, I would calm myself by rationalising that I’m just not good enough. 
              So this has helped me accept that I can do it, as long as I push myself.
            </p>

            <h3>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>

            <p>
              Keep writing in this document and reflect on the day's mistakes and successes, so I can reiterate to myself what I can do to improve upon the next day. And to not be 
              pulled down by my failures and lack of knowledge or experience, but to celebrate the fact that it is all something I will learn.

            <h2>How this affect my learning plan</h2>

            <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>

            <p>
              Thankfully for me I had already done this research as part of the Prep Curriculum before Sprint 1. As such I have already made a learning plan that was influenced in 
              part by what I’ve learnt from neuroplasticity and having a growth mindset. Something not listed on my learning plan as it did not feel as though it had enough 
              relevance to warrant its addition, was my own internal thoughts process when going to bed. When I’m calming down for the night and getting ready to go to bed I think 
              back on what I’ve learnt about how the brain is malleable and I do not have a predisposed intelligence, I feel as though this information has helped me greatly surpass 
              my own expectations of how quickly I’ve learnt new things and will continue to have a great impact on all of my future learning.
