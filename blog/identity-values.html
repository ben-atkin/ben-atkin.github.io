          <h2>Values most important to me</h2>
              <ul id="list">
              <li>Equality & Equity</li>
              <li>Honesty</li>

            <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h3>

            <p>
              Unfortunately all the instances that I’ve had to make an ethical decision are all about how I dealt with someone close to me doing something, so it feels in poor taste to air out their dirty 
              laundry on a blog even if I used pseudonyms. If I think of something in the future I’ll be sure to add it here instead, however I am stumped at this question.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>

            <p>
              My family has a very strong sense of what’s right and what’s wrong, and I believe that has been passed on to me. There are certain things I will never do purely because I was raised to believe 
              they were wrong. However, a lot of those limitations that I’ve set on myself and that I learnt from my family, I do not push onto others, they are mainly a rule set that I myself follow for I 
              only truly know myself.
            </p>
      
            <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>

            <p>
              According to the VIA Institute on Character my personal strength is honesty. I believe my honesty will help me communicate with my peers better, I’ll be more prone to admitting when I’m stuck 
              and embarrassment hopefully won’t stop me.
            </p>
      
            <h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
            
            <p>
              My limitations in terms of my learning and career development I would say would mainly be my anxiety, it’s been a constant hindrance in my life and it’s always affected me greatly. It’s likely 
              to make me more reclusive and isolated from my peers, which is something I desperately don’t want. 
            </p>
      
            <h3>
              Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your 
              reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
            </h3>

            <p>
              Unfortunately I don’t have a lot of great examples to pull from, however one example includes my friends and I playing a new game to us all called “Eco”, it is a cooperative, survival and 
              resource management game that runs in a fully simulated ecosystem on a planet. You start with stone age knowledge and tools and work your way up to modern day technology. The challenge of 
              the game is balancing how quickly and efficiently you advance your technology and the pollution you create by doing so, for the planet you're on much like our own is susceptible becoming 
              uninhabitable for life.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              My friends and I discussed a plan, and it was to divide all the tasks at hand and create professionals in certain areas, like masonry, mechanics, farming, etc. We needed people to focus 
              on a certain area of the game to get further faster. But something we didn’t account for is some of these jobs, like the “Mechanic” for instance required a lot of raw materials to be refined 
              into metals and other substances for them to then work with, so they would have to wait for the professional “Miner” to gather the required resources for them to do anything, and then when the 
              materials came it was most of the time as simple as clicking a button and then waiting for the “Mechanic”. So we ended up with people like the “Farmer” and the “Miner” doing a lot more manual 
              labour and spending more time doing gruelling and boring tasks just for the “Mechanic” to have fun watching Youtube videos and creating new tech that no one had seen before, just for them to 
              always call first dibs because they were the one that made it.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              So it created tension between the manual labourers and the tech industry, our solution was to keep the idea of focusing in a certain area to still push our tech everyday but to split more of 
              the boring and annoying tasks between all of us. We as a group tried all tasks as best we could for a day and then all decided by majority decision what were considered the worst tasks, then 
              those tasks would be equally distributed to all. Everyone had a part in the simplest foundations and also the most advanced heights we could achieve, and it more or less solved our problems of 
              people doing too much and others doing too little.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sorry for the incredibly long story, hopefully the story not only made sense to you, but you learn from our mistakes.
