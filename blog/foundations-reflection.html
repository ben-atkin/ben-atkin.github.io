            <h3>What are three new things you've learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>

            <p>
              <ol id="list">
                <li>That I'm still afraid of having to interact on a constant basis with people I'm not familiar with.</li>
                <li>My ego can be prideful at times leading me not to ask for help when I most likely should.</li>
                <li>I still have a long way to go before I'm confident in my core skills, however I do think it is achievable</li>
              </ol>
            </p>

            <h3>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>

            <p>
              To not only help people identify problems they or others might be facing, but potentially help them come up with a solution to deal with said problem. 
              Also to more effectively relieve stress and communicate properly with others.
            </p>

            <h3>What has suprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>

            <p>
              How useful and insightful it was, especially learning about neuroplasticity in sprint 4.
            </p>

            <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>

            <p>
              The listening and looping exercise was a bit nerve racking for me and I definitely felt challenged trying to speak up and ask someone to do it with me.
            </p>

            <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing of the core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>

            <p>
              To better prepare us for the workspace and give us necessary skills to get hired and climb the career ladder.
            </p>

            <h3>
              Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? 
              Justiy your answer.
            </h3>

            <p>
              Not at all, in fact it’s one of the biggest reasons why I chose to come to Dev Academy over other institutions like UC or Ara. No, I think there is a very 
              healthy balance between letting us know how to programme but more importantly how to communicate effectively and be comfortable doing so.
