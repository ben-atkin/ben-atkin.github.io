            <h3>What are three new things you've learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>

            <p>
              <ol id="list">
                <li>That I'm still afraid of having to interact on a constant basis with people I'm not familiar with.</li>
                <li>My ego can be prideful at times leading me not to ask for help when I most likely should.</li>
                <li>I still have a long way to go before I'm confident in my core skills, however I do think it is achievable</li>
              </ol>
            </p>

            <h3>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>

            <p>
              To not only help people identify problems they or others might be facing, but potentially help them come up with a solution to deal with said problem. 
              Also to more effectively relieve stress and communicate properly with others.
            </p>

            <h3>What has suprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>

            <p>
              How useful and insightful it was, especially when it came to learning about neuroplasticity in sprint 4 and the prep curriculum. I would definitely say that 
              going over that helped me quite a lot to be able to tackle all the problems that I’ve faced while learning to code. Beforehand I most likely would’ve been 
              more stubborn and unchanging, but now I’m constantly reminding myself “not yet”.
            </p>

            <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>

            <p>
              The listening and looping exercise was a bit nerve racking for me and I definitely felt challenged trying to speak up and ask someone to do it with me. 
              During the exercise it was still a little difficult to come up with the words when given the spotlight and I found myself flustered however I did manage 
              to push through.
            </p>

            <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing of the core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>

            <p>
              To better prepare us for the workspace and give us necessary skills to get hired and climb the career ladder. Dev Academy from my understanding has taken 
              lots of feedback and information from students and other companies likely to hire programmers to figure out the skills needed to get employed. They 
              articulate the course around that to give us, the student, the best chance of employment.
            </p>

            <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? </h3>

            <p>
              Not at all, in fact it’s one of the biggest reasons why I chose to come to Dev Academy over other institutions like UC or Ara. I’m hoping that all I’ve 
              learnt from the core part of this course will not only help me get employed, but help me stay employed, strengthen my personal relationships with friends 
              and family, and give me a better mindset overall.
            </p>

            <h3>Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justiy your answer.</h3>

            <p>
              No, I think there is a very healthy balance between letting us know how to program but more importantly how to communicate effectively and be comfortable doing 
              so. I feel as though core human skills is a skill a lot of people lack simply because they had never been taught by the people around them or the school system. 
              So the fact that this course has so much emphasis on building said skills is very reassuring.
